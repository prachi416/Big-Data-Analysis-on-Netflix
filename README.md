# Big-Data-Analysis-on-Netflix
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix using two distinct datasets, aiming to uncover insights into both content and user dynamics. The initial phase focuses on the content library, examining trends in TV shows and movies available on Netflix. We analyze the growth of content additions over time, categorizing them into web series and movies, and explore factors such as genre distribution, viewer ratings, and seasonal trends. Advanced Excel tools including pivot tables, VBA scripting for automation, and data visualization techniques are employed for detailed exploration and visualization.

The second phase shifts focus to Netflix user behavior and demographics. This involves analyzing subscription trends across different regions, assessing regional popularity of content genres, and examining user engagement metrics such as viewing patterns and retention rates. Gender demographics, user preferences based on ratings and reviews, and other socio-demographic factors are also scrutinized. Data is extracted and processed using SQL queries for database management, cleaned and manipulated using Pandas in Python, and visualized through interactive dashboards created with Power BI. This integrated approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's operational dynamics, leveraging advanced analytics to derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
